MicroUK101
==========

 This is a project to design a board for Grant Searle's Micro UK-101 design.
I started this in 2016 when I was very new at electronics and Kicad.
As I was interested in 6502 and OSI machines I picked this as something to
learn a bit of both things. When I finished the design in Sept 2016 I
ultimately decided not to make boards as I felt I would not really use the
board for anything serious. But it helped spur my interest in designing
more boards. I published the project on my web page and mostly forgot about
it.

 In 2022 I was contacted by someone interested in making the board so I
sent them all the files. Well, they made a run and the board worked with
only one (important) mistake... The power connector was backwards. So, I
have decided to fix that and update a few thing using the latest Kicad
and to put the files on Github for anyone interested in making their own
boards.

Gerbers files can be found in the Gerbers directory. I have not actually
made boards from these files, so use at your own risk!
